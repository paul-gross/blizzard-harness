# Feature delivery (`bzh:feature-delivery`)

## Rule

Feature delivery is orchestrated by blizzard itself: a chunk travels its workflow graph — the default shape `build → review → deliver` — and the platform owns the choreography end to end: sequencing between nodes, the review carry-back, retries and escalation, delivery, and landing.
An agent never drives that sequence by hand — it performs exactly the node role its session was primed with, exits, and the facts it reports move the chunk.

## Why

The delivery choreography is domain-modeled platform behavior — exactly-once tenure, facts-derived statuses, hub-executed delivery ([../domain/index.md](../domain/index.md)) — so an agent improvising commit-land-watch steps around it races the orchestrator it works under and produces the double-work the model exists to prevent.

## What each participant owes

- **A worker at a node** (build, review, …) owes its node's prompt, done to [../standards/index.md](../standards/index.md) and proven by the matrix rows for the touched surface ([../verification/blizzard.md](../verification/blizzard.md)) before it exits — its output reported as facts and artifacts, never a self-landed merge.
- **The hub** executes delivery itself — the merge-queue landing is a hub-executed node, no agent's role ([../domain/artifacts.md](../domain/artifacts.md)).
- **A human** enters only where invited or where failure parks the chunk — asks, gate decisions, takeover ([../domain/humans.md](../domain/humans.md)).

## Scope

This file governs feature delivery **through** blizzard.
Work on the blizzard ecosystem itself delivered outside a fleet — an agent in a winter feature environment landing to `master` by hand — follows the workspace delivery rules instead (`workspace:/context/project/contributing.md` §Delivery, with the git mechanics in `workspace:/context/worktree-ops.md`), plus [../CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for changes to this harness.

## Don't

- Hand-drive the choreography from inside a node session — rebasing, merging, pushing to `master`, or watching CI on the chunk's behalf. The deliver node lands the work; the reported facts move the chunk.
- Exceed the node role — a build worker delivering its own commit, a review worker fixing what it reviews. The graph separates the stations precisely so their outputs stay independent.
- Treat retries, escalation, or the review carry-back as the worker's to manage — a worker that cannot finish exits with its facts, and the platform derives what happens next.
