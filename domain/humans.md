# Humans in the loop (`bzh:human-entries`)

Where people enter blizzard's loop, and the two parked conditions they produce.
Definitional — a taxonomy of the human entry points (`canon:rule-shape` §File kinds).
Part of the [domain model](./index.md).

The default posture is human-**on**-the-loop: the default graph has no human touchpoints — agents verify and merge to main.
Every human entry is either **opt-in** (asks, gates) or **exceptional** (escalation, takeover); adding and removing gates is the dial between reviewing every step and supervising outcomes.

| Entry | Who initiates | Parks the chunk as | Resolved by |
|-------|---------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Ask | The worker, mid-step | `waiting_on_human` | The first answer; the session resumes around it |
| Gate decision | The workflow (a human-judged node) or runner configuration | `waiting_on_human` | A person picking one of the choices; the resolving transition follows |
| Escalation | The system, on exhausted failure | `needs_human` | Supersession — requeue makes the chunk leasable again; there is no resolution fact |
| Takeover | A person, entering a parked session | Stays `needs_human`, with human-in-session detail | Explicit hand-back — requeue |

The two parked conditions differ by cause: `waiting_on_human` is **invited** input — the model expects a person and stops the reap clock; `needs_human` is **failure** — the system ran out of moves and a person must act.
Both derive from open facts, never stored flags ([work.md](./work.md) §Statuses).

## Ask and answer

A worker that needs input asks a durable question — free-form, or with options a board or bot renders as buttons — and the chunk parks.

- **The reap clock stops** while the question is open: a chunk waiting on a person is not stalled.
- **Exactly one answer ever exists.** The first answer wins; later would-be answerers are told who won and what they said.
- **The session resumes around the answer** — the dormant agent session continues with the answer delivered into it, and the resume restarts the reap clock.

## Gate decision

A **decision** is a gate's parking row: a durable multiple-choice ask written where a worker-judged node would have written its transition, carrying the step's artifacts so the deciding human sees what they are judging.

- **The choices are the node's judgement choices** ([graphs.md](./graphs.md)) — what the board and chat bot render as buttons.
- **Pending derives**: a decision no resolving fact references is open, and the chunk derives `waiting_on_human` from it — no live lease while parked. The resolving fact is normally the transition the holding runner writes (below); when the resolved choice migrates cross-graph it is the migration record instead — or, if that migration's target is unresolvable, the escalation — since a migration writes no transition ([work.md](./work.md) §Migration).
- **Resolution is recorded once** — first write wins, like an answer — and the holding runner then writes the ordinary transition referencing the decision: the runner still advances the chunk.
- **Gates arrive two ways**: structurally, as a human-judged node in the graph; or by **runner configuration** selecting node names — human sign-off added to an existing workflow without editing any graph. At a human-judged node a runner-submitted transition is rejected; human sign-off cannot be bypassed.

## Escalation

A chunk parks `needs_human` when the system is out of moves: retries exhausted, or a worker died without a verdict past the retry cap.

- The escalation **carries the literal session-resume command**, so the person starts where the worker stopped.
- It **closes by supersession, never resolution**: requeueing makes the chunk leasable again, and the next attempt's lease is what closes the escalation — there is no "resolved" fact to write.
- An open escalation also **appears as one `needs-human` event** in the unified operational event log ([operations.md](./operations.md)), projected at read time — its own fact and supersession rule are unchanged; the log just gives `needs_human` one home alongside the other operational events rather than a separate surface.

## Takeover

A person may enter a parked chunk's session interactively; the entry and exit are recorded facts.

- **No lease exists during a takeover** — the chunk stays `needs_human`, with human-in-session detail, until it is explicitly requeued.
- **Hand-back is explicit**: the person requeues the chunk; nothing infers that a human is done.
