# Work — the chunk and its lifecycle

The unit of work at the center of the model: the chunk, the statuses it derives, the transition record it moves by, and the migration that re-pins it across graphs.
Definitions, with the enforceable invariant written in the slot skeleton owned by `winter-canon:/rule-shape.md` (`canon:rule-shape`).
Part of the [domain model](./index.md).

## Chunk

The hub's unit of orchestrated work: it wraps one or more backlog items from the backing project-management system by pointer, travels a workflow graph, and accumulates artifacts, questions, and decisions as it goes.

- **The PM item is the durable referent; the chunk is ephemeral.** An unacquired chunk may be discarded or grouped away, and re-ingesting the same item mints a fresh chunk — nothing of value lives only on an unstarted chunk. An item already wrapped by a live chunk cannot be ingested again.
- **The item's contents are never stored.** A chunk holds pointers; reads pass through to the backing system.
- **Pinned to exactly one immutable graph, once it has left `not_ready`.** The pin is set at mint from a default and, while the chunk still rests `not_ready`, is a plain editable selection — the operator's one pre-flight window to repin it. Once the chunk leaves `not_ready` the pin is immutable and changes only when a [migration](#migration) applies — never silently.
- **The model selection is a chunk property alongside the graph pin.** Set at mint from the default, editable only while the chunk rests `not_ready`, immutable thereafter — the same pre-flight window as the graph pin, not a fact log.
- **The intended migration is a chunk property alongside the graph pin and model.** Nullable — `null` when no migration is queued, otherwise an intent naming a mode (`auto` or `forced`), a target graph, and, for a forced intent, a target node. Unlike the graph pin and model's pre-flight-only window, it is set, overwritten, or cleared by the operator at any non-terminal status. Applying it re-pins the chunk and clears the intent atomically, in the same write as the migration ([migration](#migration)).
- **Nothing on it is a stored status.** Its current node derives from its newest accepted transition, and its status derives from its recorded facts (`bzh:facts-not-status` in [../architecture/system-shape.md](../architecture/system-shape.md)).
- **Held by at most one runner at a time** — see [execution.md](./execution.md) for acquisition, tenure, and fencing.

## Statuses

The derived conditions a chunk can be in.
A chunk has exactly one status at a time — the conditions are checked in a fixed precedence, and none is ever a stored column.
The exact fact vocabulary and derivation queries live in the code. This table is the behavioral meaning.

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `not_ready` | Minted and resting — visible on the board, never claimed. The one window the chunk's graph pin and model selection are editable in place; an explicit promote moves it to `ready`. |
| `ready` | Ingested into a chunk and unclaimed — in the hub's queue with no live route. |
| `running` | Claimed by a runner and being worked. |
| `delivering` | In the hub's own hands — queued for or undergoing delivery, or awaiting an external merge; the holding runner keeps its environments until the outcome is known. |
| `waiting_on_human` | Parked on **invited** human input — an open ask or an unresolved gate decision ([humans.md](./humans.md)); the reap clock is stopped. |
| `needs_human` | Parked on **failure** — retries exhausted, or a worker died without a verdict; a person must requeue or take over ([humans.md](./humans.md)). |
| `paused` | Held on an operator's per-chunk pause fact — on a live route the runner kills the worker but keeps the lease, route, epoch, environments, and retry budget so resume respawns in place; an unclaimed chunk is withheld from the queue instead. Ranks below the human-gated statuses and above `delivering`/`running` ([execution.md](./execution.md)). |
| `stopped` | Abandoned by an operator — terminal at any point after acquisition, artifacts and history retained. |
| `done` | Terminal — the chunk reached the graph's reserved terminal transition. Ordinarily this is immediate once the commit artifacts land, but a graph may instead route further runner work after landing before reaching it, so landing itself is not necessarily terminal ([artifacts.md](./artifacts.md) §Landing is not necessarily terminal). |

Discarding or grouping an unacquired chunk is not a status: the chunk is simply gone from every listing, because the PM item remains the durable referent.

## Transition

One entry in a chunk's append-only movement record: the fact that a judgement at a node's exit selected an edge and the chunk moved along it.

- **Every transition is fully formed.** The judgement is what selects the edge — the worker's verdict, the hub's own machinery at a hub node, or a human's choice at a gate — so there is no unjudged movement and no transition without a judgement.
- **At a gate there is no transition until the human decides.** The node-step's completion lands as an open decision, and the resolving choice writes the transition referencing it ([humans.md](./humans.md)).
- **Atomic with the step's artifacts.** A node-step's transition and its artifacts are committed as one write — a rejected transition's artifacts never exist ([artifacts.md](./artifacts.md)).
- **Fenced.** A transition carries its attempt's epoch and a stale one is rejected, never recorded (`bzh:epoch-fencing` in [execution.md](./execution.md)) — the movement record only ever advances on a live attempt's say-so.
- **Authored by the holder.** The holding runner reports the chunk's transitions; the hub's own executor authors them for hub-executed nodes.

## A migration is never a transition (`bzh:migration-not-transition`)

**Rule.** Movement between graphs, for a chunk that has left `not_ready`, is a **migration** — its own recorded fact re-pinning the chunk — never a transition: a transition moves a chunk along an edge within its pinned graph, and no edge crosses graphs. While a chunk still rests `not_ready` its graph (and model) selection is a plain editable property, not a pin this rule governs — that window closes the moment the chunk leaves `not_ready`.

**Why.** Transitions are judged, fenced movement within one immutable definition; letting one span graphs would re-route in-flight work without the explicit intent, record, and fencing that migration provides. Before the chunk has run at all, there is no in-flight attempt to re-route and nothing a migration's fencing protects — repinning is pre-flight selection, not movement.

**Detect.** A design or change in which a transition's two nodes belong to different graphs, an edge targets a node of another graph, or a chunk **that has left `not_ready`** has its graph pin change with no migration record.

**Do.** Re-pin via a migration record — either immediately, as an authored judgement choice's own trigger, landing on the departed node's name-matched node or the target's entry node when no name matches; or later, deferred to the chunk's next transition, via its own `intended_migration` property, landing on that transition's own destination node or a named node for a forced intent — in neither case is a fresh epoch minted at migration time, and the landed node's own executor then governs the chunk's status exactly as it would for an ordinary transition (§Migration below). Edit a `not_ready` chunk's graph or model selection in place; no migration record applies to a chunk that has never run.

**Don't.** Add a cross-graph edge, or update the pinned graph of a chunk that has left `not_ready` in place with no record of the re-pin.

## Migration

The explicit re-pin of a chunk from one immutable graph to another, recorded as its own fact — never a transition (`bzh:migration-not-transition`).

- **Intent and fact are separate.** An authored judgement choice about to be taken, or a chunk's own standing intended migration (see [Chunk](#chunk)), is intent — not yet a movement; the migration *record* written when one actually applies is the fact. The intent is a plain mutable column, like the graph pin and model, not a fact log: setting it overwrites whatever was set before, and setting it to nothing clears it, so a chunk holds at most one live intent at a time, with no history of superseded ones to reconcile.
- **A judgement choice can trigger it immediately.** A node's authored judgement choice may target another graph rather than a sibling node (`to: graph:<name>` in [graphs.md](./graphs.md)); taking that choice is itself the trigger — the worker's verdict ends the attempt at that node and records one migration fact re-pinning the chunk (optionally re-pinning the model the choice names) and landing it at the target's landing node (§Landing is by name below). The authored **choice** carries the cross-graph target, but when taken it records a **migration**, never a cross-graph transition, so `bzh:migration-not-transition` holds. A choice whose target names no enabled graph escalates the chunk to `needs_human` rather than dropping the movement.
- **A chunk's own intended migration can trigger one later, at its next transition.** Unlike an authored choice, which fires as its own verdict, a standing intent is consulted — never applied eagerly — when the chunk's next transition is judged, through the same path an ordinary worker verdict or a resolved gate decision takes; a chunk advancing through a hub node's own exit is not consulted this way, so an intent set on a chunk already in the hub's hands waits for its next worker-or-gate transition. An **auto** intent migrates only when that transition's own destination node name also exists on the target graph, landing on that same-named node; otherwise the transition applies unchanged on the current graph and the intent stays set for the transition after. A **forced** intent migrates unconditionally to its own named target node, regardless of what that transition's own destination would have been. When the intent's target graph cannot be resolved at consult time — never minted, or retired since the intent was set — the migration is skipped exactly like an auto no-match: the transition applies unchanged and the intent stays set, visible for the operator to cancel or re-aim.
- **Neither trigger interrupts the attempt that produced it, or mints a fresh epoch at migration time.** The verdict carrying a migrating transition is accepted exactly as an ordinary one would be, and nothing about the submitting attempt is fenced or redone — a fresh epoch is only ever minted by a later claim, the same as for any other route-released re-queue. The two triggers differ only in **where** they land — each anchors a different name, per §Landing is by name below: an authored choice lands on the departed node's own name-matched node because that node diverted rather than completed its own destination; a standing intent lands on the transition's own destination node (auto) or its own named node (forced), because that transition did complete normally and the intent simply redirects where it lands.
- **Landing is by name.** Landing resolves a node by **name** on the target graph (`bzh:ids-exact-names-correlate` in [graphs.md](./graphs.md)) — the trigger picks which name is the anchor: an authored choice anchors the departed node's name, falling back to the target's entry node when no match; a standing intent anchors the transition's own destination node name for `auto` (no entry fallback — an unmatched name just leaves the transition unchanged, per the bullet above), or the intent's own named node for `forced`. **The landed node's own `executor` then governs exactly as it does for an ordinary transition** ([graphs.md](./graphs.md) §Node): landing on a hub-executed node derives `delivering`, not `ready` — the chunk stays in the hub's own hands, driven by the hub's own executor, same as any other arrival at that node — while landing on a runner node re-queues `ready`. This keys on the landed node's `executor`, never its name; the shipped `deliver` node is one hub-executed instance a migration can land on, not a special case.
- **An `auto` intent is a per-chunk request, not a graph policy.** The operator sets it explicitly on the chunk itself; nothing on a graph migrates chunks by itself.
