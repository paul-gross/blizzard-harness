# Architecture — blizzard

Blizzard's **architecture guidance**: the structural invariants and design decisions a change must honor, read when planning a change or reviewing a plan.
Conforms to the canon concept at `winter-canon:/architecture-guidance.md`.
Where the companion [standards/](../standards/index.md) domain governs the code-quality details a finished change is held to, this domain governs how the code is *structured and designed* — consulted before writing new code so you build with the existing structure rather than reverse-engineering it.

**Read this index before changing the code of any blizzard daemon, seam, or store**, and follow the one row that matches your change rather than reading the whole tree.

Parent: [../index.md](../index.md).

| Doc | When to read |
|-----|--------------|
| [./clean-architecture.md](./clean-architecture.md) | Placing new behavior — the CLEAN layering blizzard carries over from winter: screaming layout, a dependency-free domain core, dependency inversion, and injection at the composition root |
| [./repository-access.md](./repository-access.md) | Touching persistence or a controller — the read/write repository split, which layer may write, and the domain-takes-objects rule |
| [./system-shape.md](./system-shape.md) | Designing a daemon, an external-system seam, or a store schema — the deterministic-shell/intelligent-core split, the pluggable-seam rule, and store-facts-derive-status |
| [./crash-correctness.md](./crash-correctness.md) | Building or changing a daemon loop or its store — the four requirements that make `kill -9` at any step boundary a tested operation |
