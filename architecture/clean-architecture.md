# CLEAN architecture

The CLEAN-architecture aspects blizzard carries over from winter-cli — the layering every blizzard daemon, the CLI, and the mock fleet are structured by.
Each rule follows the slot skeleton owned by `winter-canon:/rule-shape.md` (`canon:rule-shape`).

## Screaming, domain-grouped layout (`bzh:screaming-architecture`)

**Rule.** Group functionality by the domain concept it serves and name the grouping after that concept, so the top-level package layout announces what the system does — chunks, workflow, delivery — not which framework it runs on.

**Why.** A layout named for its domain lets a cold agent find the code for a behavior from the behavior's name alone, without a framework map; a layout named for frameworks (`routers/`, `models/`, `services/`) scatters one domain concept across every technical bucket.

**Detect.** Top-level packages named for a framework or a technical layer (`api/`, `db/`, `schemas/`) rather than a domain concept; one feature's code split across several such buckets.

**Do.** Top-level packages `chunk/`, `workflow/`, `delivery/`, `lease/` — each owning that concept's domain types, its repository seam, and its edge handlers.

**Don't.** Top-level packages `models/`, `routers/`, `crud/` that force every chunk-related change to touch three unrelated directories.

## A dependency-free domain core (`bzh:domain-core`)

**Rule.** Business rules live in a domain layer that depends on nothing outward — no FastAPI, no SQLAlchemy, no click, no filesystem or network; frameworks, stores, and transports sit outside it and depend inward.

**Why.** A domain core free of outward dependencies is testable at the unit tier without a store or a server standing up, and survives a framework swap untouched; a domain that imports the ORM cannot be reasoned about or tested without it.

**Detect.** A domain module importing `fastapi`, `sqlalchemy`, `click`, `httpx`, or `pathlib` I/O; a business rule reachable only by standing up a store or an HTTP app.

**Do.** A `chunk` domain type and its transition rules that import only other domain types and the `winter-canon:`-agnostic standard library; the store and the API depend on it.

**Don't.** A domain function that opens a SQLAlchemy session or reads a request object — the rule now cannot run or be tested without the framework.

## Dependency inversion across owned interfaces (`bzh:dependency-inversion`)

**Rule.** Separate concepts by an interface *owned at the inner layer* and implemented by the outer one: the domain declares the seam it needs (a Protocol), and the store, forge, harness, or workspace adapter implements it.
The reference shape is the Protocol-seam + `internal/` adapter + factory-injected error pattern in [../exemplars/python/repo_pattern.py](../exemplars/python/repo_pattern.py).

**Why.** When the inner layer owns the interface, the outer layer is a plug the inner never names — swapping a store or a forge (`bzh:pluggable-seams`) changes only the adapter, and tests substitute a fake by type. An interface owned by the outer layer inverts the arrow and drags the framework back into the core.

**Detect.** A domain service that constructs or imports a concrete adapter class instead of depending on a Protocol; an interface defined in the adapter package and imported inward.

**Do.** The domain declares `IChunkStore` (a `Protocol`); `internal/sqlalchemy_chunk_store.py` implements it; the domain never imports the adapter.

**Don't.** The domain imports `SqlAlchemyChunkStore` directly, or depends on an `IChunkStore` defined in the adapter module — either way the arrow points outward.

## Wire at the composition root (`bzh:dependency-injection`)

**Rule.** Nothing constructs its own collaborators; every dependency is injected, and the concrete wiring happens once at the composition root.
The injected clock (`bzh:injected-clock`) is a member of this rule, not an exception to it.

**Why.** Injection at a single root is what lets a test build a daemon with a fake store, a virtual clock, and a mock forge without patching module globals; a class that news up its own store hard-codes the production collaborator into every test of it.

**Detect.** A service instantiating a store, an HTTP client, a clock, or a subprocess runner in its own `__init__` or method body instead of receiving it; module-level singletons read directly rather than injected.

**Do.** The daemon's container binds the store, clock, and seam clients once; each service receives them through its constructor.

**Don't.** A coordinator that calls `SqlAlchemyChunkStore()` or `datetime.now()` inside a method — the collaborator is now unswappable and the method untestable in isolation.
