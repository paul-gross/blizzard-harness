"""Canonical repository-pattern example.

Read this when adding a new repository class or extending an existing one.
The shape codifies the three seams the blizzard architecture rules require
(architecture/clean-architecture.md, architecture/repository-access.md):

  1. **Protocol seams, I-prefix names, read/write split.** The public callable
     surface is a `Protocol` named `IRead<Foo>Repository` / `IWrite<Foo>Repository`
     (bzh:repository-split). Services depend on the narrowest variant they need
     (bzh:controller-read-only): a controller holds the read Protocol, the domain
     holds the write Protocol. The domain owns these Protocols, the adapter
     implements them (bzh:dependency-inversion) — the arrow points inward.

  2. **`internal/` adapter placement.** Concrete implementations live under an
     `internal/` subpackage (e.g. `<feature>/internal/foo_repository.py`). The
     Protocol file lives at the feature-package root, alongside the service that
     uses it. Anything under `internal/` is package-private and must not be
     imported from outside the feature.

  3. **Factory-injected error wrapping.** Library exceptions are turned into the
     domain `RepoError` by an injected `RepoErrorFactory.from_*` method, not by
     inline `raise X from Y` at every call site. The factory logs once at the
     wrap site (structlog, standards/logging.md) with structured fields, so the
     reporter and dashboard render them without re-parsing.

The DI container binds the Write variant where mutations are required and the
Read variant where they aren't (bzh:dependency-injection) — the Protocol type
is the contract, and tests substitute a fake by type.
