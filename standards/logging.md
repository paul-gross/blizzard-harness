# Logging

How blizzard code emits diagnostics.
Follows the slot skeleton owned by `winter-canon:/rule-shape.md` (`canon:rule-shape`).

## Structured logging with structlog (`bzh:structlog-logging`)

**Rule.** All logging goes through **structlog**, with the output renderer selected by configuration — a **JSON renderer** when agents, services, or CI consume the logs, a **human console renderer** (colored key-value) for interactive runs, defaulting by TTY detection and overridable by config/env.
One call-site convention regardless of the renderer: pass structured fields as key-value pairs, never interpolated into the message string.
The level conventions:

- **ERROR** — a wrapped exception at the boundary that transforms it, logged **once** at the wrap site (the injected error factory, [../architecture/repository-access.md](../architecture/repository-access.md)) and never re-logged by callers.
- **WARNING** — a recoverable condition the caller continued past (a skipped item, a missing optional config).
- **INFO** — a major lifecycle event (`reconcile started`, `chunk delivered`): one line per event, not per item.
- **DEBUG** — per-item traces (per-chunk step, per-repo action), opt-in via log level.

No `print()` in daemon or service code — use the injected reporter for user-facing output and the logger for diagnostics; `print()` belongs in CLI top-level glue only.

**Why.** Structured fields let the JSON and console renderers, the dashboard, and CI all render the same event without parsing a message string, and TTY-selected rendering means one call-site serves both an agent reading JSON and a human reading a console — the intelligence lives in the renderer, not the call. Logging a wrapped error once at the boundary keeps a crash trace to a single record instead of one duplicate per layer it passed through.

**Detect.** A `logging.getLogger` / stdlib-logging call or a second logging library used instead of structlog; structured data interpolated into the message string (`f"failed cwd={cwd} exit={code}"`) rather than passed as fields; a catch-log-rethrow that logs an error already logged at its wrap site; `print()` in daemon or service code.

**Do.** `log.info("chunk delivered", chunk_id=chunk.id, repo=repo.name)` — the event as the message, the context as fields; renderer chosen by config.

**Don't.** `log.info(f"chunk {chunk.id} delivered to {repo.name}")` — the fields are now trapped in the string, and no consumer can filter on them.

**Gap.** structlog is not yet wired in the `blizzard` seed; the configuration-selected renderer and the call-site convention land with the app scaffold (phase 5).
